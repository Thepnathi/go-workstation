An interface is a type with a specific set of method signature
Any type that matches the method signatures implicitly implements the interface

You don't have to explicityly declare that you're implementing "interface X"


Interface allows us to call code which is unaffected by what the underlying type
or implementation as long as it match the method signatures.
